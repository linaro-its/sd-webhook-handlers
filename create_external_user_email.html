        <p>Dear {0}</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>An account has been created for you on Linaro's Login service and the next step is for you to set your password. Please go to <a href="https://login.linaro.org/">https://login.linaro.org/</a> and click on "Forgot password?". Enter the following email address and click on OK:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>{1}</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You will receive an email with a link in it. Click on the link and set your Linaro Login password.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You <b>must</b> do this before you can use Linaro's systems.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Please note</b> that some of Linaro's systems can take up to an hour to recognise your password after it has been changed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you require SSH access to servers, you can store your SSH public keys on <a href="https://login.linaro.org/">https://login.linaro.org/</a>. After logging in with your email address and password, you will see the "SSH keys" section where you can paste your key(s).</p>
        <p></p>        
        <p>Don't forget to click on "Save" after adding your keys!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Information about the supported format of public keys can be found at <a href="http://linaro.co/OpenSSHKeys">http://linaro.co/OpenSSHKeys</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>When using SSH, your username is <b>{2}</b>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT!</b> You will receive an email every six months to confirm that you still need this account. If you do not click on the link in that email within a month of receipt, your account will be closed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you have any problems, please email <a href="mailto:it-support@linaro.org">it-support@linaro.org</a> or raise a ticket by going to <a href="https://it-support.linaro.org/">https://it-support.linaro.org/</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Best regards</p>
