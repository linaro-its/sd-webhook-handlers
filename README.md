# About this repository
This repository is a collection of request type handlers used by Linaro in conjunction with the [Jira Service Desk Webhook Framework](https://github.com/linaro-its/sd-webhook-framework).

Each handler is unlikely to be usable outside of Linaro without changes but they serve to show how the underlying framework can be used.

Since the ID number assigned to a given request type will vary on each installation of Service Desk, the handlers in this repository are named after their function.
