Thank you for registering for Linaro's Developer Cloud.

An account has been created for you on Linaro's Login service and
the next step is for you to set your password. Please go to

You will receive an email with a link in it. Click on the link and

*Please note* that some of Linaro's systems can take up to an hour
to recognise your password after it has been changed.

In order to access the Developer Cloud systems via SSH, you need
to store your public SSH key(s) on Linaro Login. After logging in
with your email address and password, you will see the "SSH keys"

Don't forget to click on "Save" after adding your keys!

When using SSH, your username is {2}.

IMPORTANT! You will receive an email every six months to confirm
that you still need this account. If you do not click on the link
in that email within a month of receipt, your account will be
closed and any Developer Cloud projects will be shut down.
