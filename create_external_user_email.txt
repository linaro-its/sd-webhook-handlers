Dear {0}

An account has been created for you on Linaro's Login service and
the next step is for you to set your password. Please go to
https://login.linaro.org/ and click on "Forgot password?". Enter
the following email address and click on OK:

{1}

You will receive an email with a link in it. Click on the link and
set your Linaro Login password.

You *must* do this before you can use Linaro's systems.

*Please note* that some of Linaro's systems can take up to an hour
to recognise your password after it has been changed.

If you require SSH access to servers, you can store your SSH public
keys on https://login.linaro.org/. After logging in with your email
address and password, you will see the "SSH keys" section where you
can paste your key(s).

Don't forget to click on "Save" after adding your keys!

Information about the supported format of public keys can be
found at http://linaro.co/OpenSSHKeys.

When using SSH, your username is {2}.

IMPORTANT! You will receive an email every six months to confirm
that you still need this account. If you do not click on the link
in that email within a month of receipt, your account will be
closed.

If you have any problems, please email it-support@linaro.org or
raise a ticket by going to https://it-support.linaro.org/.

Best regards

Linaro IT Services
